            Make a new to-do list every day, even if you're not a big list maker
            and only jot down the big projects, look at it every day and cross
            off what you've completed (or what you've deemed no longer
            relevant). Not only will this help keep you on top of your tasks,
            but it will also make you feel productive when you cross off that
            item after it's been completed. Make sure that youâ€™re going to start
            your day with a purpose.
